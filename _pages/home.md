# About Pumpkin House Games
We're a small indie game studio that started out as a couple of college friends living in a pumpkin colored house. We loved playing and creating video games, admiring all the medium had to offer. After some game jam projects and ideas, we built and released our first game Wander Vyrosa for Windows. 

Although our team has since graduated college, we still love making games together and sharing our experiences along the way. The games we create value your intelligence, while also aiming to create approachable and engaging experiences with loads of exploration and strategic depth.
